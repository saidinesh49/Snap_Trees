# Snap Trees

Visualize, Interact, Understand: A Live Playground for learning Tree-Based Data Structures

</div>

Snap Trees is a tool built with React.js and D3.js that helps users understand how tree-based data structures behave. It supports live insert, delete, and search operations on Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and B-Trees. An integrated AI assistant explains each operation in real time, making complex logic easier to follow and explore.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Tree Operations**: Perform insert, delete, and search across multiple tree types in real time.  
- **Visual Learning with D3.js**: See algorithm behavior through smooth, animated transitions.  
- **AI Chatbot Integration**: Get clear, step-by-step explanations of logic, properties, and time complexity.  
- **Multiple Tree Support**: Toggle between Binary, BST, AVL, Red-Black, and B-Tree structures.  
- **Explore Concepts**: Dive into the dedicated *Explore* section with labeled modules for each treeâ€”compare, contrast, and build real intuition.
